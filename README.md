# Multi-People-Chat-Room
1. There can be multiple clients, each client has its own name (unique)
2. The client can send a message to the chat room, and everyone can see the message just sent.
3. There is only one server, and a separate main thread starts and manages the server.
4. If a client connects successfully in the server, start a new thread and the current client session.
5. Both client and server have interfaces
